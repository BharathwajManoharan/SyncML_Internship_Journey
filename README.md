# Sync_ML_Internship

Welcome to my ML Internship Github repository! Over the next four weeks, I'll be sharing my journey towards becoming a Data Scientist or ML Engineer.

During this internship, I'll be working on four exciting projects, one for each week.

In the first week, I'll be creating a chatbot using natural language processing techniques to provide helpful responses to users.

The second week will see me building a real-time face mask detection system that can identify people who are not wearing masks in public places.

In the third week, I'll be exploring Boston housing dataset to predict the price of a house based on various features.

Finally, in the fourth week, I'll be working on a sign language classification project to help recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures.

I'm thrilled to be embarking on this journey and can't wait to share my progress with you. Follow along and join me as I learn and grow as an ML Intern!
