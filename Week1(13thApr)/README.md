## Getting Started
To use this project, please follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Download nltk_data from idle
Download the nltk_data package from the official website. This package contains the necessary data for natural language processing.

## Step 2: Create a virtual environment and activate it
Create a virtual environment to install the project dependencies. You can use venv or conda to create a virtual environment. Activate the environment once it is created.

## Step 3: Install the required packages
Install the following packages using pip:

* tensorflow
* keras
* nltk
* pickle
* flask

## Step 4: Train and save the model
Run train.py to train the model. Once the model is trained, it will be saved to the current directory.

## Step 5: Run the application
Run app.py to launch the application. If the model was trained and saved successfully in the previous step, the application should work as expected.

That's it! You should now be able to run the application and use the trained model. If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on this repository.
